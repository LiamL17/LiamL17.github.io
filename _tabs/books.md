### Atomic habits
Where to start... This book is simply amazing. The goal of the author, James Clear, is to teach the reader the importance of micro or rather atomic habits. As these habits stack on one-another, they can used to grow the perfect lifestyle or grow to your greatest obstacle daily, if negative habits build up. This remarkable piece dives in depth on the steps that should be followed to build atomic habits. Before the advice on how to accomplish these habits start, James teaches the reader the importance of all actions. He uses a 4-word summary. This being everything we do is related to the below:

1. Cue: What triggered you to want to do something.
1. Craving: You want to do something because of x, y and z.
1. Response: What you do.
1. Reward: What you feel afterwards.

James focuses on these 4 elements of all actions throughout the whole book and teaches the reader how to specifically dive deep into each of the sections. As you read further into the book the example become specific and the book closes off with a section that expands on life lessons from the four laws.
