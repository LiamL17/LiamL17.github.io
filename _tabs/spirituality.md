## Through the Bible
### Isaiah
16/11/23 - 
#### Day 1
Chapter 1-3
Isaiah speaks what the Lord has told him. How the Lord feels about the people turning away from Him. They focus on the things of the world, riches, bribes, gifts and nothing from God. Isaiah is very clear how the wicked will fall. God also mentions that He wants to clean them and wash them as white as snow. He tells them they do have another chance. Chapter 2 speaks of the mountain of the Lord. This sounds like a wonderful place to be! Does this mountain refer to Heaven?

#### Day 2
Chapter 4-8
Chapter 4 mentions that the Lord is the perfect branch and the only branch we should get food from. Chapter 5 is song of the vineyard. Where Isaiah speaks of how Judah and Isreal are turning away from the correct wine. Very interestingly this chapter speaks of staying up late drinking and waking up chasing after their drink. Chapter 6 is awesome! Isaiah saw the Lord and the seraphims surrounding the Lord. One of them brought Isaiah a live piece of coal taken from the alter to eat so that he may be clean. God asks who will speak to the people and Isaiah says I am here. As a prophet you must always be ready to say "Here I am" when God calls. In chapter 7 Isaiah's son is mentioned. I never knew he had a son. Isaiah prophecies the birth of Immanuel.

Isaiah had a child with a prophetess in chapter 8! The last part of the chapter speaks of people calling to spiritists and the dead when they are still alive. Let demons stay dead and darkness dark. Let us call on the living light!

### Ezekiel
16/11/2023 -
#### Day 1
Chapter 1-4
Ezekiel was only 13 when God called him. He saw visions of God and the angels. These chapters describe how awesomely powerful God is. He explains in depth how the angels looked. How bright, powerful and mighty they are. 

In chapter 2 Ezekiel is tasked by God. He is also given a scroll he must eat. On the scroll were words of lament, mourning and woe.

In chapter 3 God puts Ezekiel through many things that would kill a man. I perceive this as God building confidence in Ezekiel. Showing him that the Lord will save him. He also mutes Ezekiel as God knows he would want to rebuke and kill all of them.

In chapter 4 Ezekiel is told by God to eat defiled food. Food cooked over human excrement. Ezekiel says no to God and God changes His mind to allow Ezekiel to eat food cooked over cow dung. I cannot believe that one of the great prophets openly said no to God!
