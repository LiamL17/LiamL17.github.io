## Through the Bible
### Isaiah
16/11/23 - 
#### Day 1
Chapter 1-3
Isaiah speaks what the Lord has told him. How the Lord feels about the people turning away from Him. They focus on the things of the world, riches, bribes, gifts and nothing from God. Isaiah is very clear how the wicked will fall. God also mentions that He wants to clean them and wash them as white as snow. He tells them they do have another chance. Chapter 2 speaks of the mountain of the Lord. This sounds like a wonderful place to be! Does this mountain refer to Heaven?
