## Sharing tools
It seems like this week we are focussing on awesome websites I found! In the future I would like to have a separate page where all the amazing website I have discovered are summarized. But for now you have to read through this late-night-quick-thinking post to see what I'm fussing about.

### Nuclino
[Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/) is an amazing website that allows multiple people to share thoughts. In essence it's another Notion.so, but with some unique features like all good websites. I have been using it to jot down some ideas for this exact blog. It has a really neat feature of a graph view. It groups items together and it's exactly what I looking for. I always have great ideas for the blog, but regularly forget them. Below is how my tiny graph is looking as of time writing this.

### Leading conversation
I learned that I am _really_ good at leading people into very specific conversations. We had a games night at the Fourie's household and a very specific task was giving to each person attending. Without going into too much detail about this specific game[^1], the base of it is to lead conversations to extract specific info about a person. I ended up winning the game with 4 out of my 5 tasks being unnoticed. This taught me that I can lead conversations to obtain specific information. I believe this is a strength I've hidden from myself and would love to explore it.
(Ps. This was all fun and games. I have no intention to extract information that would hurt or damage a person.)

### Colors galore!
[Realtime colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=180202-fafafa-ff6d4d-e6e6e5-d12600&fonts=Poppins-Poppins) is an amazing website to design color schemes. I, personally, am not proficient in design[^2]... So that makes the discovery of these websites a true blessing. The website allows me to visually pair colors and obtain a rough idea for the direction of my app or design.

### How far we've come
It still baffles me that I can start up and EC2 instance within a few seconds. Well after the 4 hours spent to find the right settings for the instance, but you get the point. That was mind-blowing until I discovered [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop). It is a website where you can drag and drop a folder of static HTML, CSS and Javascript. The app will create an app from the source files you provided and allow other people to access it. I can't explain it further, you just have to try it yourself!

[^1]: I want to build it into an app so I am gatekeeping, sorrrryyyyy...
[^2]: I am improving though! I have some tasks I'm tackling to improve this skill!
