## Welcome to TWIL II
On this weeks episode of "_This week I learned_" we'll be exploring some neat Typescript libraries, the future of suggestions through AI as well as the power of Kotlin.

## zod vs io-ts
As every developer knows, the more quirky the name of a package, the better the performance. This might not be true for all cases, but for _zod_ it is certainly the case. [Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a "typescript-first schema validator with static type inference" as defined in their documentation. I think Zod is best explained through an example. Stealing from another post [^1] we have a response from a request in the form of 

```json
{
    "def": "extremely well",
    "exp": ["his performance went over big"],
    "gloss": "extremely well; his performance went over big",
    "lemma": "big",
    "lexFilenum": 2,
    "lexId": "3",
    "lexName": "adv.all",
    "pos": "r",
    "ptrs": [],
    "synonyms": ["big"],
    "synsetOffset": "00227671",
    "wCnt": 1
}
```

Since we have the wonderful (although useless) Javascript, we can access each of these items with a simple `request["<someKey>"]`. This is nifty, but errors will arise in the future... \*insert shocked emoji\*

That is where the magic of Zod shines through. Zod allows us to define a schema which can parse this result. The resulting parsed object will be strictly typed and members can be accessed with the all mighty dot operator. Aka the above ~~Javascript~~ Typescript now translates to `request.<someKey>`. Where `<someKey>` can only be one of the defined keys in the schema. The schema mentioned is a set of Zod functions used to create a model representing an object. 

The schema mentioned above is defined below.

```typescript
const resultSchema = zod.object({
    def: zod.string(),
    exp: expSchema,
    gloss: zod.string(),
    lemma: zod.string(),
    lexFilenum: zod.number(),
    lexId: zod.string(),
    lexName: zod.string(),
    pos: zod.string(),
    ptrs: ptrsSchema,
    synonyms: synonymsSchema,
    synsetOffset: zod.string(),
    wCnt: zod.number(),
});
```
For brevity I have omitted the schemas defined for `ptrs` and `exp`.

So after all that, why do I say Zod is better than io-ts you wonder? Simply because it's more popular. Zod has 19k stars compared to 6.1k for io-ts. I know stars isn't the only definition of a great library, so I look at the third condition (the first being the funky name) -- the documentation. Zod has extensive documentation on _EVERYTHING_  the library offers. Nothing is unclear and dare I say some of the docs are too detailed. Where is the suspense in saying WTF does this function do?

In conclusion, Zod is overpowered, io-ts is great, Typescript is a gift to the world and Javascript exists.

## ChatGPT is _really_  cool
This one won't come as a shock to many, like at all. BUT! ChapGPT is the future of everything. I know I sound like a fangirl, but hear me out for a sec. I thought of a couple of playful names for my VS Code extension, but nothing sparked my mind. Then I went to the future (of ideas) and asked the all mighty ChatGPT to come up with a name for my extension. This is how the conversation unfolded:

As we can see, ChatGPT gave a great couple of ideas with the best idea given first! After thanking the emotionless computer for the suggestion it even gave me the cutest good luck message for my project. I am ashamed to say that I did blush a little bit.

## A personal flaw
Sadly the last thing I learned this week is that I have a deviated septum. The nasal septum is the cartilage and bone in your nose. This bone divides the nasal cavity into the two sides. A deviated septum is the term used when this bone is off-center or leans to one side.

This _flaw_[^2] is easily fixed through a [sepoplasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septoplasty) surgery. So, I will be having a small surgery sometime in the future to correct this.


[^1]: For an in depth explanation have a read through the "_Writing a VS Code extension_" post. And before you blame me for this shameless plug, don't worry I am well aware.
[^2]: It's not necessarily a flaw, but it adds to the drama or better known as good writing!
