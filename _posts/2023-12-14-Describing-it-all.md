# Describing it all
I had this idea of wanting to describe myself in different ways and thought it would be a fun exercise. But as the idea started mending in my mind I realized I could extend this to _everything_. So, get ready to engage in what might be the oddest yet detailed description of _everything_.

## My girlfriend
We'll start with someone very close to my heart, Deandra. A few days ago she asked me why she isn't on my blog although some other people are. I responded with what I thought was obvious, but in hindsight wasn't. I said it's for her privacy. She said she had no issue with it so here we go. World, meet my beautiful girlfriend and future wife. There might not be a ring yet and a verbal promise with a view, but I know in my heart she's my forever.

Without any further ado let's describe. Deandra is like a mother to all children. Deandra is as beautiful as the winning national graphic photo each year. Deandra smells like the grass after rain. Deandra is as witty as Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. Deandra is as hot as California's Death Valley. Deandra hugs like a chonky cat. Deandra smiles like the waves of the sea. Deandra fights like a chihuahua. Deandra sleeps like a sloth. Deandra often imitates penguins. Deandra loves like Jesus. Deandra kisses better than a teenage girls' wallpaper. Deandra flirts likes George Clooney.

These are but a few descriptions of my future person. I believe she will pop up quite often throughout the times, but for now I leave you with one last picture. Deandra is the moon to my sun.

## Me, Myself and I
These set of descriptions will be a bit different...

Liam is roughly the wingspan of 3 penguins doing the cha-cha in height.
Liam weighs the same as 232 cans of fizzy soda.
Liam has the eye color of the inner circle of a 7 year old R5 coin.
Liam has the wisdom of about 46 owls wearing glasses.
Liam has the eyesight of a Ferruginous Hawk.
Liam can bench press the weight of 1.4 baby elephants in gold coins.
Liam can snatch the weight of 18 watermelons (seedless of course).
Liam has the patience equivalent to a squirrel in a peanut factory when apps are slow.
Liam is as calm as a fridge magnet.
Liam is as old in days as a value between the 21st and 22nd Fibonacci number.
Liam's mind is like the Mandelbrot set.
Liam would question Aristotle.
Liam can be as humble as a doorstep yet confident as a lock.
Liam loves sport as Jesus loves the church.
Liam loves swimming as the sun likes rising.
Liam's time keeping is on par with Japan's railway system.
Liam's dreams are as wide as Jupiter as Mars.

## For now
I'm feeling tired. I'm feeling accomplished. I'm feeling like tomorrow is going to be a good day. I feel like I did a good job. I feel a bit of stomach pain. I feel the wind blowing from my bedroom window. I feel the pain in right wrist as it's pressing against the bottom of my laptop. So with all these feelings in mind, I'm going to stop describing everything for now...
