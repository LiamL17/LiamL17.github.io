## Water cooler chats do in fact work!
What an odd title to start learning about types of fun. Allow me to explain. We have just finished our daily developer stand-up and as the morning requires of any developer, I head to the coffee machine. I grab my generic white cup and double tap the flat white option. The 60ml default coffee amount won't cut it. I modify it to 75ml and lower the milk output from 14 seconds down to 10. As my coffee pours I ask Adrian how was the weekend. He said it was good, but busy. He had a lot of _type II fun_. What an interesting statement. He asks if I know about the different types and you can guess the answer.
Here am I learning and writing about types of fun from a water cooler (right next to the coffee machine) chat. Amazon was right all along! You do in fact engage more in person with a water cooler conversation.

## Fun (/f ån/)
Fun is subjective, but it can be formally defined as other complex words. These being "enjoyment, amusement, or light-hearted pleasure"[^1].
