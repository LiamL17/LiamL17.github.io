#### What it means to "Begin with the end in mind"
#### All things are created twice

#### Leadership and management - The two creations
#### Rescripting: becoming your own first creator

#### Writing and using a personal mission statement
#### Using your whole brain
#### Two ways to tap the right brain
#### Expand perspective
#### Visualization and affirmation
#### Identifying roles and goals
We each have different roles in our lives. Major problem is thinking too narrow. Need to break down mission statement to specific roles and goals you want to accomplish in each area. This chapter includes an example of a mission statement that is defined amazingly. The last section of this chapter emphasizes the importance of identifying roles and goals in your life.

**Thoughts**
- What goals do I have currently?
- What are my roles?

#### Family mission statements
This chapter expands on the previous with a focus on family. A family mission statement can be just as important as a personal one. Each individual of the family needs to have input into how the family as a whole can live in harmony and love one another to the best of their ability. This mission statement becomes the foundation of thinking and governing the family. This section also touches on the importance of using the mission statement as well as continuous review thereof.

**Thoughts**
- Stephen has their family mission statement on a wall. I would like to do this with my wife and kids one-day.

#### Organizational mission statements
Just as with personal and family mission statements, it's extremely important for organization as well. This section tells a story of a hotel with excellent service where Stephen learns that the organization has a mission statement, but so does each branch and within the branches does each group of people. All the mission statements are grouped into one following the same principles. Without involvement there is no commitment. A mission statement that reflects deep shared vision and values of everyone creates a unity and tremendous commitment.

**Thoughts**
- I don't think I am currently aligned with the AWS mission statement. How can I change this?

#### Application suggestions
1. Funeral visualization
2. Roles as I now see them. Am I satisfied with the mirror image of my life?
3. Word on personal mission statement. Set time for it.
4. What centers and circles do I identify with?
5. Collect notes, quotes, ideas to be used in mission statement.
6. Identify project where I want to use mission statement. Write down results.
7. Share the principle of habit 2 with those around me.

### Habit #3 - Put first things first
**Principles of personal management.**\\
This introduction to the third habit begins with two questions and thereafter explains how this habit differs from the first two. Habit one stated "you're the creator. You're in charge" and focussed on the four unique human endowments of _imagination_, _conscience_, _independent will_ and _self-awareness_. Habit two is the first or mental creation.

Habit three is the second creation, the physical creation. It's the day-in, day-out, moment-by-moment doing it. This habit is also about management. The left-brain focussed aspect of habits.

**Thoughts**\\
The quote "Manage from the left; lead from the right." is immensely powerful.

**Other**\\
Two questions at the start:
1. What one thing could you do (you aren't doing now) that if you did it on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in your personal life?\\
Eating healthy.
1. What one thing in your business of professional life would bring similar results?\\
Following a daily structure.

#### The power of independent will
Our independent will is related to our personal integrity. It's the value we place on ourselves. It's the ability to make and keep commitments to ourselves.

Leadership decides what "first things" are and management puts them first. Effective management is about putting first things first.

Discipline derives from disciple. You must become a disciple to your goal. From the book of "The common denominator of success" it's evident the only factor is the ability to put first things first. From this book it's mentioned that the group of successful people has a habit of doing what failures don't like to do. They don't like it as well, but their disliking is subordinated to the strength of the purpose.

**Thoughts**
- The 12 disciples of Jesus. They had extreme discipline to leave their old lives as is and move onto following Jesus. Am I a disciple to my goals?
- Do I have a mission or goal strong enough that I want to submit to?

#### Four generations of time management
Habit 3 focusses on time management and for that we need to understand the generations thereof. Generation 1 could be considered notes and checklists. Generation 2 would be calendars and appointment books. The third generation includes the other, but also includes daily planning. It is _efficient planning_. This generation does not leave time for relationships, quality of life and spontaneity. The fourth generation -- although hidden -- focusses on preserving and enhancing relationships and accomplishing results. It focusses on P/PC balance.

**Thoughts**
- I have gotten better at gen 1, and still struggle with gen 2. How can I move from this to gen 4?
