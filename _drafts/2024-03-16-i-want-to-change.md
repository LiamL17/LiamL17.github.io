I am getting married in 189 days. In 6 months and 5 days. In 27 weeks. And I want to change.

This sentence abbreviated and capitalized is **IWTC**. These are the four letters I want to engrave on my heart over the coming 27 weeks.

The question is why now? What has changed so that I want to change? The answer is simple. I have been wanting to change for a very long time. The reason for writing this is the conviction I have to put this out into the world. I want to keep myself accountable over the next 6 months and the easiest way to do that is accountability. Accountability in this sense, is the reminder that I need to update the pretend (or hopefully real, if you're reading this) audience of these blogs. But deeper to that, I want to have a series of reminders of that I can look back on in my life and keep myself accountable for those 27 weeks.

This blog and those in the future will be exactly that. Content would include goals, learnings, struggles, ideas, encouraging words and just about anything regarding my life I ponder about.

## I am overweight
The first struggle I've had for over a decade is my weight. This started just before I turned 13. I was a normal schoolboy that performed quite well in rugby and enjoyed my time in the first or rather A team. After primary school ended my motivation also ended. As I finished trials for rugby teams in my first year of highschool, I ended up in the 4th team as a reserve. I had dropped from the best to the worst. This was devastating, but the only person to blame is me, myself and I. I decided to become a sluggard and have been paying for this sin for years to follow. I won't get into the mental or psychological side of this doing, but I just wanted to note that down so that I have a reminder of it.

The question is yet to be answered, what do I want to change? \
I want o have control over my weight. I want to be at a point where I'm comfortable with myself. Not being shirtless in front of friends, family and sadly, myself. I currently weigh around **122 kg** and I want to weigh around **110 kg** or lower. I believe this will be lower, I just don't have an idea of how I'd look and feel around that weight. I also don't want to lose too much muscle as I enjoy my big frame and well muscles are sexy.

That answers the question in a rough sense, but I want to define it directly. \
I want to lose **12 kg** over the coming 27 weeks. I want to achieve this on a 5 week basis. The first 5 weeks, I want to lose **5 kg**. I want to weigh **116.9 kg** on 20 April 2024. I want to weigh **113.9 kg** on 25 May 2024. Lastly, I want to weigh **109.9 kg** 03 August 2024. These are the goals I want to measure against. I do however know weight fluctuates and I won't be exactly on these targets, but I want to be near for days on end.

Lastly, I want to weigh less than **110 kg** on my wedding day. On 21 September 2024.

## I have bad eating habits
It's quite obvious that the weight issues come form bad food intake. I want to start with a confession here. I am lazy. I don't like making food. I also have a strong addiction with sugar. I have a daily intake of all or at least some of the following: sweets, chocolates, chips and cooldrink. This usually occurs at night time right before I go to sleep. This is obviously a straight path to obesity, diabetes and death. Alongside these addictions, I also am very fond of buying fast food. This includes just about anything. Burgers, chips, toasted sandwiches, you name it.

I want to stop this. This is my biggest challenge. To set SMART goals for this is going to be tough, but I have a few. The first to complete a week without any of the above mentioned substances. I want to achieve this by May 2024. The second is to plan a week of meals and stick to it. That I don't change a single thing. This, I want achieved by June 2024. The last goal which I have started, but want to perfect is tracking macros. I want a have a week where everyday is closely accurate to what exactly came into my body. I want to achieve this by June 2024 as well.

## I have bad habits
There are quite a few habits that I have which I despise. Some of them mentioned above, but some others I want to work on as well. The first is sleep. I always fall asleep to some video. Whether this be minecraft, coding, hacking, Netflix series or a random meme video. Every single night. I want this habit broken by 21 August 2024. Next is my mindset about my amazing job. I often work less than 35 hours, heck even 25 hours a week. The sole reason is that I am lazy. I need to force myself to simply do the work. I want to have a 40 hour work week clocked in before June 2024. On top of that I want to write a weekly blog about **IWTC**. In this blog I will provide updates on my goals as well as mention how I am feeling. I want to publicly rate myself.

The next habit I struggle to break as I don't even think it's a negative one. I enjoy a nap. Daily. I also think naps are essential, but I often use them as an excuse. I will say I'm napping for an hour, but rather spend time on my phone and then attempt a nap. I want to go nap free for 7 days in a row before June 2024. I also want to have a full week where I nap for maximum 30 minutes at a time. This means the time I decide to nap until I start the next task. I want to achieve this before May 2024.

The next habit I want to break is social media addiction. I have indoctrinated myself to the point where I can't go a day without this awful mind killer. I want 3 days without an social media before May 2024. I also want to limit my screentime for social media to 20 minutes a day for 14 days in a row. I want to achieve this before August 2024.

I enjoy reading. A LOT! I have sadly stopped reading. I want to read 20 pages a day starting 18 March until 21 September 2024. I also want to meditate on the Word of God. I want to think about what I read. I want to have a month whereby I spent 10 minutes a day thinking about what I read in the Bible that day.

## I am weak in some exercises
I am strong. I have always been strong. This is in opposition to many activities that I enjoy. These include squash, jogging and gymnastics movements in crossfit. I want to be able to complete these without anguish. I want to complete 8 clean pull-ups by June 2024. I want to do a muscle up by 21 September 2024. I want to run a half marathon before 21 September 2024. I want to play a 70+ minute squash match with a heart rate average of below 180 before July 2024. I want to be able to do a great amount of kipping pullups before July 2024.
