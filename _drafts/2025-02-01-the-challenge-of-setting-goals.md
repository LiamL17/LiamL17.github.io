## Let's define it
A pair of posts linked by a crossbar! Technically the truth, but I want to focus on other goals. Let's define the "goal" we'll use:

> the object of a person's ambition or effort; an aim or desired result  

The _Google definition_.

That definition, although perfect, is too formal for my liking. A _goal_, for me, is something __I want__ to __achieve__ in the __future__. Note the three bold words. We will dive into these key facets of a goal in the next section. 

Before, we dissect goals, I want to share a story on personal goals within my life. As of this typing this word, I am busy with my third post within a week. The last post prior to this set was almost 2 months ago. I had a goal to write 20 posts within the year of 2024 and obviously did not reach it. By far. However, I'm married now, have a fixed-hours job, studying two long-term courses, and much more, but I'm posting more. How come? What is the difference? Let's not spoil it all yet and get back to this a bit later!

## Anatomy of a goal
"__I want__", "__achieve__", and "__future__" are key for any goal. From these a goal, by definition, needs to be:
- Personal
- Possible
- Futuristic

### 1. Personal
A goal must be defined by an individual for themselves. You have to believe that this exact object is your own. About four-quarters of the time a stolen goal will result in a failure. You should be aware of the objective keeping it as personal as possible. Now one might argue that [KPIs](https://www.qlik.com/us/kpi#:~:text=KPIsKPI%20Examples-,What%20is%20a%20KPI%3F,the%20organization%20make%20better%20decisions.) are goals set by managers for you. I would slightly agree, however I would not define these as goals. These are simply measures of performance that have items attached. A goal, by definition, should be personal. An objective, target, mark, and aim are better words to describe KPIs in my personal opinion.

### 2. Possible
I want to have a six-pack at 140kg, ripped to the bone while being mentally stable. I want to be like Chris Bumpsted, 4-time Olympia champion. I want to be as rich as Elon Musk, whose worth exceeds South Africa's GDP. I want, I want, I want. All personal, yet impossible. I don't have the skills these folk have. I don't have the time. I don't have the conviction. One might think of this as a limiting mindset, but I would argue it's a skill to know where the heart truly lies. A goal needs to be possible within context, natural law and the self. It most certainly needs to stretch you. All the while keeping possible in the back of your mind.

### 3. Futuristic
A fancy word for a basic principle. A goal needs to be focused on the future. It's an objective that **will** be reached. It's not past yet. I can't find more ways to explain this. A goal must be for _later_. You decide the _later_, no one else.

### Being SMART about goals

### WOOP WOOP
Blown away, taken aback, mind opening. Some of the emotions I experienced when my church leader, Ruben, introduced me to this method.
